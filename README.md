<b>Data about Hate Crime in England and Wales released by police forces via FOI requests.</b>

On February 2018 I submited the first Freedom of Information to a UK police force asking for data related to hate crime. Four months after, I got relevant information from 26 of the 39 England police forces. 

## The original FOI request

Dear X Police or Constabulary,

This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act.

I would like you to provide me with the following information:

- Hate crimes and incidents recorded. For each, the total number and the breakdown by monitored strand (race, religion, sexual orientation, disability and transgender, or other classification available) and by offence type (violence against the person, public order offences, criminal damage and arson…, or other classification available), for each month of the calendar years 2015, 2016 and 2017.

- Hate crimes and incidents flagged as online crime recorded. For each, the total number and the breakdown by monitored strand (race, religion, sexual orientation, disability and transgender, or other classification available) and by offence type (violence against the person, public order offences, criminal damage and arson…, or other classification available), for each month of the calendar years 2015, 2016 and 2017.

- In the cases classified as religious hate crime, the breakdown by the perceived (by the offender) religion (or belief or faith) of the victim.

- The date since when the online crime flag is being used by this police force.

I would like to receive that information in an electronic format, preferably in .xlsx or .csv.

If the information requested is not clear enough or if the cost of compliance exceeds the appropriate limit, I would appreciate your assistance in rewriting or narrowing down my search terms.

Yours faithfully,

Victòria Oliveres

PS: I would like to clarify that by "Hate crimes and incidents flagged as online crime recorded" I mean crimes which have occurred online (cyber crime), no matter if they have later been reported online or in other ways.

## The answers

Police forces recording systems differ, and so does the format and structure of the data they provide. Some release the figures of the cases individualised and anonymised and others aggregate them; some put together an Excel file, others a Word and others a PDF… Even if asking for specific breakdowns or details, each force has a different answer and it takes time in merging, ordering and cleaning the data.

Also, some forces have changed their categorisations of aggravated strands over the time and have been using online marks for different periods of time, which leads to inconsistencies in the data and non-reliable trends. At least, non-reliable to explain a change in crime levels.

I've put toghether all the monthly data of hate crime reports by hate strand and police force and the breakdown of the reports committed online, which can be accessed in <a href="https://github.com/vicoliveres/hate-crime-FOIs/blob/master/HATE CRIME FOIS_all.xlsx">this spreadsheet</a>. But more analysis can be done, for example, extracting the breakdown by offence. 

In the different folders above you'll find the answers and data I was provided with. So feel free to deep into the figures!

Although FOI requests' answers are public and this ones will probably be published soon, I would appreciate if you would cite my work of filling the requests and putting the information together.
