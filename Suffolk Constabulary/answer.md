A search has been carried out via the Constabulary’s crime system for all reports of hate crime during 2015, 2016 and 2017.

1.	The attached spreadsheet provides details of hate crimes recorded, broken down by month for the years specified. 

The information is broken down by monitored strand, month/year and offence type.  

It is important to note that at present to be able to provide you with this data it has been taken from the information we send to the National Community Tension Team for their hate crime returns, this is the only report we can run to extract this data down to this level.  The template they use groups race/religion as the same band so this is the information that we have been able to provide at this time.  Likewise there is a ‘Faith’ category therefore we have provided this in addition.  Suffolk Constabulary is currently working on a report that can be run to separate race and religion which will mean this data will be available in the future.

Please note that the 2015 data is separated within 2 tables, this is due to the fact that Suffolk Constabulary changed crime management systems to Athena in October 2015, and therefore the data from each system is separated.

2.	Tab 2 of the attached spreadsheet provides hate crimes that have been flagged on our crime system Athena as being an online crime.

	The information is broken down by monitored strand, month/year and offence type.

3.	The perceived religion by the offender of the victim is not actively recorded within our crime system, and therefore are unable to answer this question.

4.	The online crime flag was introduced with our new crime system in October 2015.
