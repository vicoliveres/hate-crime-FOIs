The information requested is not held in a format that can be retrieved within the permitted time allowed.  To explain, incidents are not broken down by offence type.  The cyber flag is only used on crimes. There is a qualifier code which can be applied to incidents with a cyber element but as only two qualifiers can be applied per incident and one of these will be a hate qualifier, it is unlikely this will be a reliable measure of cyber related incidents.   Each crime/incident may fall into more than one category. For example if a crime was motivated by both faith and race this crime would be counted once in each category. This means that all hate crimes do not equal the overall total of hate crimes/incidents.   Therefore to establish if an incident has a cyber element, each incident would have to be read. As there are 5288 hate incidents, each one would have to be manually reviewed to obtain this information.  Even at a conservative estimate of 3 mins per record, this would take in excess of 18 hours to complete.  This section does not oblige a public authority to comply with a request for information if the authority estimated that the cost of complying with the request would exceed the appropriate limit of 18 hours, equating to Â£450.00

 

You should consider this to be a refusal notice under Section 17 of the Act your request.

 

Although excess cost removes Northumbria Police's obligations under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, as a gesture of goodwill I have supplied information below, relative your request, retrieved or available before it was realised that the fees limit would be exceeded.

 

With the above in mind, the information provided is the total for each strand by month and year only.  Please see attached spreadsheet.  I trust this is helpful, but it does not affect our legal right to rely on the fees regulations for the remainder of your request.
