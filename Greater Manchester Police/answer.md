Caveats:

This data contains hate crime and incidents (see below for definitions) recorded between 1st January 2015 and 31st December 2017 where the hate incident flag is equal to Yes, excluding cancelled crimes.

Hate crime definition: hate crime is defined as any criminal offence which is perceived by the victim or any other person to be motivated by hostility or prejudice based on a person’s char-acteristics or perceived characteristics defined within the five monitored groups (hate motiva-tions) plus alternative sub-culture. This is due to some hate crimes have more than one moti-vation. e.g. someone may perceive that a hate crime is motivated by both their disability and their ethnicity.

Hate incident definition: a hate incident is defined as any non-crime incident which is per-ceived by the victim or any other person to be motivated by hostility or prejudice based on a person’s characteristics or perceived characteristics defined within the five monitored groups (hate motivations) plus alternative sub-culture. An incident report opened or closed with a hate code or qualifier is not automatically counted as a hate crime or hate incident until it is record-ed within the crime recording system in compliance with the Hate Crime policy.

The alternative subculture, disability, race, religion, sexual orientation and transgender hate motivation flags have been provided to allow the requester to identify the “monitored strand”. Multiple hate motivation flags may be applied to crimes and hate incidents e.g. crime number 42 has both the race and religion hate motivation flags applied. Consequently, the sum of each motivation will be higher than the total number of hate crimes and incidents.

The crime tree level 2 has been provided to allow the requester to identify the “offence type” and differentiate between hate crimes and incidents.

The cybercrime flag has been provided to allow the requester to identity “hate crimes and in-cidents flagged as online crime”. GMP introduced the cybercrime flag to its systems in April 2014 but its use has increased rapidly as the definition of cybercrime has been refined and awareness of cybercrime has improved. Consequently, a change in the number of crimes with a cybercrime flag may not reflect a true change in this type of crime. In addition, this method of recording depends on officers and staff applying the flag where relevant, and anal-ysis has suggested that it is not being applied consistently. Consequently, the number of hate crimes and incidents with a cybercrime flag may not reflect the true number of cybercrimes. 

The Anti-Semitic flag, Anti-Buddhist flag, Anti-Christian flag, Anti-Hindu flag, Islamophobic flag, Anti-Sikh flag, Targeted religion – none targeted flag, Targeted religion – other religion flag, Targeted religion – other religion, Targeted religion – unknown flag and Religion have been provided to allow the requester to identify “the breakdown by the perceived (by the of-fender) religion (or belief or faith) of the victim”. GMP introduced these fields to its systems in April 2016 (with the exception of the Anti-Semitic and Islamophobic flags, which have been used since 2007, and the Religion).
