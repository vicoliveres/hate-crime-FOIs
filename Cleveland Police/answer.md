Having made enquiries within the Force we have attached a document with all the information we have been able to retrieve. Please note these are crimes which were validated in that time period, regardless of when the crime occurred. The other strands of hate crime have one tab for all years. They are categorised by the Home Office Codes e.g. VAP (Violence against the person). For faith/religious crimes we have used the faith of the victim if it is stated – if not it is ‘unknown’. We also added a column for whether or not the crime has a ‘cyber flag’ attached, which is the only way I can tell if the crime occurred on line or not. However the use of the cyber flag is not always guaranteed to be 100% accurate.

Please note that all statistical data supplied in relation to Freedom of Information requests is a snapshot of data held at the time the request was received by the Freedom of Information office and is subject to constant change/updates.
