DECISION 
I have disclosed the located information to you. Please find attached information pursuant to your request above. Please note that the 'MR - Online / Internet Enable Crime' has been used by the MPS from 01 April 2016.

CONTEXT 
The MPS is committed to tackling hate crime in all its forms, supporting victims and their families and bringing perpetrators to justice. We have long since recognised the impact of hate crime on communities and the hidden nature of this crime, which remains largely under-reported. 

We have more than 900 specialist officers across London working in our Community Safety Units who are dedicated to investigating safeguarding matters, including hate crime.

The MPS has recently formed a special hate crime senior partnership group which has a focus on creating and delivering an effective hate crime operational strategy for London. This is being developed in partnership with strategic and community partners, demonstrating its ongoing commitment to reducing the harm caused by hate crime and increase the confidence of victims. 

No one should suffer in silence. We are always seeking ways to increase reporting and we work with a number of third party reporting sites, so victims who would otherwise feel unable to approach police direct can report crime to non-police organisations and individuals. Victims of hate crime can, in addition, now report online on the MPS.
